  p I don’t know myself, only the echo of a name whispered by ghosts in a house that forgets time.
  p The mirror shows a face I might have borrowed from a dream my grandfather once forgot.
  p Banana leaves rot by the roadside, yet they speak more clearly than my memories do.
  p Even the rain knows where it came from—but I drift like dust through Macondo’s broken silence.
  p I walk through days stitched from fog, waiting for someone to tell me who I was before I vanished.
