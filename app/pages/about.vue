<template lang="pug">
.w-full.text-lg.italic(class="first-letter:text-4xl font-mono")
  p.mb-2 I don’t know myself—just a commit lost between branches that never merged.
  p.mb-2 Frameworks rise and fall like forgotten empires, each leaving a syntax I no longer speak.
  p.mb-2 Once, I believed in a single source of truth, but now even my state is scattered.
  p.mb-2 The DOM shifts when I’m not looking, like the town that changed names with every deployment.
  p.mb-2 And in the end, I wonder—was it me, or just another version that got cached and left behind?
